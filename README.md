# Database Schema

SQLite was used during the development of the site and then moved to Postgres in Heroku.

 <img src="docs/schema/database-schema.png">


-   ##  Applications

    -   ### Product
        - This app controls the products in the store. There are three models used to store various data: `Category`, `Product` and `ProductReview`.
        
        - `Products` enables items to be added to the database for them to be viewed and purchased. Only users that have superuser status can add items to the store through the `add_product` view. This model is connected to the `Category` model through a foreign key.
        - `Category` stores category names and is connected to the `products` model, which allows the products to be filtered easily on the site.
        - `ProductReview` allows the user to create a review for a product. It is connected by the product slug. It is also connected to the user's username which gets displayed on successful reviews posted.
    
    -   ### Checkout  
        - This app handles the purchasing of items in the store. It contains two models: `Order` and `OrderLineItem`.

        - `Order` contains the user's shipping details needed for the order to be completed. It is a foreign key to the `UserProfile` which stores the user's information is saved. It also contains the items in the basket, the total costs, and stripe_pid    which is used to handle the online card payments. Also generates a unique order_number through UUID.
        - `OrderLineItem` stores all details for the specific order. It has a foreign key to `Product` and `Order` to capture all this information.

    -   ### Profiles
        - This app contains a model `UserProfile` which stores the user's default billing information. It is also connected to the User model through a OneToOneField.

    -   ### Wishlist
        - This app contains two models called `WishList` and `WishListLineItems`. This allows the user to save items to a list for later purchase.

        - `WishList` is connected to the User model through a OneToOneField which distinguishes which user is saving items to their list. It is also connected to the product model through a ManyToMany field which also the user to choose these products for their list.
        - `WishlistLineItem` is connected to the `Wishlist` and the `Products` model through a foreign key. Due to using a through in the  `WishList` model, the items from that model and passed through this model to be displayed.

# Marketing

## SEO Research 

-   Research was done to decide what keywords to use to attract protentional customers.
-   Keywords for the site is about the future of personal electric vehicles.
-   The idea of helping the environment by reducing carbon emissions.
-   The idea of enjoying your daily commute more.
-   Being in less traffic.
-   Exploring your surrounding more, taking journeys you wouldn't normally take.
-   To attract the board sport enthusiasts.
-   A markup Facebook page was created for the fictional store.

   <img src="docs/readme/facebook-template.png"> <img src="docs/readme/seo.png"> 

With this information the eCommerce application would be a business-to-customer model (B2C) where products will be sold using single payments. The site will promote the benefits of personal electric vehicles for the user and the environment. It would need to use social media marketing to demonstrate the different devices and how they function. The site would have an easy payment method with stripe, an authentication system, search functionality, user reviews, and ratings.

## Code Validation 

-   HTML

    -   Used [W3C Validation](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate the HTML code.

    <img src="docs/readme/html-validator.png">

-   CSS

    -   Used [(jigsaw) validatior](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate the CSS code.

        <img src="docs/readme/css-validator.png">

-   JavaScript

    -   [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) was used to check for any major errors in the scripts.

-   Python Code

    -   No errors were returned when testing python code with [PEP8](http://pep8online.com/)
    -   Except for some instances where imports were asking for docstrings in GitHub and class 'x' has no 'DoesNotExist' member which is a warning from pylint. 
    -   Django adds the `objects` and 'DoesNotExist' properties to all model classes, so the IDE isn't aware of this.
    -   This happens in the `update_total` and `save` in the `checkout` app. At this stage, the code is inert as these lines currently have no use. These functions can be updated in the admin when an order is placed. The order can be accessed in the admin and can be adjusted successfully which shows that everything is working as intended.
    -   These changes appear in the user's order as intended.

## Automated Testing  

- No automated testing was done for this project.
- Ideally, class-based views should have been used to make this process more manageable.


# Bugs

-   Users who have items in their basket who then log out lose their items.
-   Due to the different sizes of the product images used, in the all products view, the images of the different items don't quite match up.
-   Hompage images are too large and user might not know of content below. Images on change moves the whole page.

## Bugs Solved

-   The update and delete from basket buttons were placed in a div to give the CSS properties, this caused the update button to no longer function. Buttons were then placed without the div and given different bootsrap CSS properties to achieve the same look with the addition of both buttons working as intended.

# Deployment

The master branch of this repository has been used for the deployment version of this project.

## Github and Gitpod

- The [Code Institute](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) template was used to develop this project. To use this template:
    - Click `use this template`
    - Create a repository name
    - Click `create a repository from template` to create.
    - After the repository is created, click on gitpod to open the workspace.
    It- Best to pin this workspace to your Dashboard for convenience.
    - Committing changes should be done often with:
        - `git add` adds all modified files to the staging area.
        - `git commit -m "A message explaining commit"` commits changes with a message.
        - `git push` pushes all committed changes to the GitHub repository

- Forking the GitHub Repository

    - If you want to make changes to your repository without affecting it, you can make a copy of it by 'Forking' it. This ensures your original repository remains unchanged.

    - Find the relevant GitHub repository
    - In the top right corner of the page, click the Fork button (under your account)
    - Your repository has now been 'Forked' and you have a copy to work on
    - Cloning the GitHub Repository

- Cloning your repository will allow you to download a local version of the repository to be worked on. Cloning can also be a great way to backup your work.

    - Find the relevant GitHub repository
    - Press the arrow on the Code button
    - Copy the link that is shown in the drop-down
    - Now open Gitpod & select the directory location where you would like the clone created
    - In the terminal type 'git clone & then paste the link you copied in GitHub
    - Press enter and your local clone will be created.

## Gmail SMTP

- Gmail SMTP was used to send emails for user related features with Allauth and confirmation emails on orders.
- Used the following [documentation](https://kb.synology.com/en-br/SRM/tutorial/How_to_use_Gmail_SMTP_server_to_send_emails_for_SRM) to set it up.
- Added the following in settings.py

## Stripe

- Stripe was used to handle the online payments for the site. It was implemented using the Code Institute lessons along with the official stripe [documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/quickstart).
- Added the following in settings.py.

<img src="docs/readme/stripe-config.png">

## AWS

- Static and media files are stored using Amazon's AWS cloud service.
- The S3 and IAM services were used to achieve this. The following [documentation](https://codeinstitute.s3.amazonaws.com/fullstack/AWS%20changes%20sheet.pdf) by Code Institute was used as a guide.
- Added the following in settings.py

<img src="docs/readme/aws.png">

## Deployment to Heroku

- Followed the steps from the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.s3.amazonaws.com/fst/Django%20Blog%20Cheat%20Sheet%20v1.pdf) document.
- Use `pip3 freeze --local > requirement.txt` to create a list of packages for Heroku to install for your app.
- From Heroku create a new app with the region closest to you.
- Then enter the resources tab and install Heroku Postgres.
- Navigate to the settings tab and under config vars, set them according with the relevant data

<img src="docs/readme/heroku-config-vars.png">

- Due to a breach of security the project needs to be deployed using the Heroku CLI from the workspace:
    - Login to heroku `heroku login -i`
    - Enter your email and password.
    - Connect to Heroku git remote with `Heroku git: remote -a APPNAME`
    - Push to Heroku with `git push Heroku main`
